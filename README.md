## 🧠 Implemented Image Processing Features

### 🔥 Thermal Heat Mapping
Applies a thermal color map to visualize image intensity variations.

### 🧩 Morphological Gradient
Highlights object boundaries using morphological image processing operations.

### 🪞 Half-Image Mirror
Creates a symmetrical image by mirroring one half of the original image.

### ✨ Unsharp Masking (Image Sharpening)
Enhances image details by emphasizing high-frequency components.

### 🖼️ Border Framing
Adds a solid border around images with configurable thickness and color.
